## Calculation Logic

### Base Rate Calculations

#### Individual Professional Rates
```
Beginner: $25-50/hour equivalent
Intermediate: $50-100/hour equivalent
Advanced: $75-150/hour equivalent

```

#### Business Value Calculations
```
Traditional Hiring Costs:
- Recruitment: $5,000-15,000 per hire
- Onboarding: $2,000-5,000 per employee
- Benefits/Overhead: 25-40% of salary
- Risk of poor hire: 50-150% of annual salary

Platform Alternative:
- No recruitment costs
- Minimal onboarding required
- No benefits/overhead
- Guaranteed outcomes reduce risk to near zero
```

### ROI Formulas

#### For Individuals
```
Monthly Platform Income = (Hours per Week × 4.33) × Hourly Rate × Multipliers
Annual Platform Income = Monthly Income × 12
Net Benefit = Platform Income - Opportunity Cost - Time Investment
ROI Percentage = (Net Benefit / Time Investment) × 100
```

#### For Businesses  
```
Traditional Project Cost = Direct Costs + Overhead + Risk Premium
Platform Project Cost = Project Fee (guaranteed outcome)
Cost Savings = Traditional Cost - Platform Cost
Time Savings = Traditional Timeline - Platform Timeline
Total ROI = (Cost Savings + Time Value Savings) / Platform Investment × 100
```
