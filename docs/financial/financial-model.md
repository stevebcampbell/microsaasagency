## Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log

### Log ID & Resultant Version: FM-001 -> v2.0
**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The financial model existed as a standard business projection document but needed enhancement to reflect the platform's evolution toward human-authenticated AI collaboration and demonstrate how this methodology impacts financial performance.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: Framework integration directive requiring all documents to include "The Crux" summary and logic log documentation as part of repository standardization.

**Raw Human Input**: Financial model update requirement to align with Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log framework and demonstrate business value of authentication methodology.

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: The decision to enhance the financial model with framework integration serves multiple strategic purposes: it positions our authentication methodology as a financial differentiator rather than just an operational feature, demonstrates to investors that transparency and human-centricity drive superior unit economics, and provides concrete evidence that our approach delivers measurable business value. The financial projections already showed strong performance, but now they're explicitly linked to our unique human-authentication approach.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Transformed standard financial projections into strategic positioning document that connects methodology with measurable business performance and investor value.
