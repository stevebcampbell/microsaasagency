## Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log

### Log ID & Resultant Version: SS-001 -> v2.0
**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The technology stack was designed for general fractional development operations but needed alignment with the Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log framework to ensure all tool selections support and facilitate the human-authentication methodology rather than creating barriers to transparent collaboration.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: Technology alignment directive to ensure infrastructure supports framework implementation rather than treating it as separate operational requirement.

**Raw Human Input**: Technology stack evaluation and enhancement to prioritize tools that facilitate logic log creation, collaborative documentation, and transparent human oversight processes.

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: The decision to align our technology stack with framework requirements reflects the understanding that tools must enable rather than complicate our human-authentication methodology. This means prioritizing solutions that facilitate collaborative documentation, version control for logic logs, transparent communication, and easy integration of human oversight into AI-assisted processes. The enhanced technology stack now serves as both operational infrastructure and framework enablement system, ensuring every tool contributes to our competitive advantage rather than creating friction for our unique approach.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Transformed standard technology recommendations into framework-aligned infrastructure that specifically supports human-authentication processes and logic log workflows.
