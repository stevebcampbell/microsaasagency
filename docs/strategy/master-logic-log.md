## Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log

### Log ID & Resultant Version: ML-001 -> v1.0
**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The repository lacked a centralized system for tracking and aggregating all human decision-making rationale across documents, creating potential gaps in transparency and accountability.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: User directive to implement master log as central aggregation point for all logic entries.

**Raw Human Input**: "there should be the log at the bottom of each document creates, and also a master log"

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: Created master log as the authoritative source for all authenticated human reasoning across the platform. This decision addresses the need for stakeholder transparency, audit compliance, and strategic oversight. The master log serves as both an operational tool for the team and a trust-building mechanism for clients who need to verify human oversight of AI-assisted processes.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Established systematic tracking of human decision-making across entire repository, enabling better governance and accountability.
