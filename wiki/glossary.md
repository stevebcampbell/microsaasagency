**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The glossary existed as a standard reference document but needed enhancement to include framework-specific terminology and position itself as a tool that demonstrates our commitment to clear, transparent communication as part of our human-authentication methodology.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: Documentation enhancement directive to ensure all reference materials support framework understanding and consistent terminology usage across the platform.

**Raw Human Input**: Glossary expansion requirement to include Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log terminology while maintaining utility as comprehensive business reference.

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: The decision to enhance the glossary with framework-specific terminology serves multiple strategic purposes: it standardizes communication around our unique methodology, helps team members and clients understand our approach, and demonstrates our commitment to transparency even in basic reference materials. By adding framework terms alongside standard business terminology, we position our methodology as an integral part of our business operations rather than an add-on feature, while maintaining the glossary's utility as a comprehensive reference tool.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Transformed standard glossary into framework-supporting reference tool that reinforces our unique methodology while providing comprehensive business terminology.
