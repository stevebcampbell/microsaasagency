## Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log

### Log ID & Resultant Version: CP-001 -> v2.0
**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The original client proposal template was designed for traditional fractional development services but lacked integration of the Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log framework that now defines our platform's competitive advantage.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: Implementation directive to enhance all templates with framework integration as part of repository-wide standardization.

**Raw Human Input**: Template enhancement requirement to demonstrate human-authenticated methodology to prospective clients through proposal structure and content.

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: The decision to enhance this template with "The Crux" format and framework references serves multiple strategic purposes: it immediately differentiates our proposals from traditional agencies, demonstrates our methodology before the client even signs, and positions transparency and human authentication as core value propositions. The template now serves as both a sales tool and a practical demonstration of our framework, building trust through methodology rather than just promises.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Transformed standard proposal template into strategic differentiator that wins projects through demonstrated transparency and human-authenticated processes.

**Categorisation Tags**: [Template Enhancement], [Sales Tool], [Framework Demonstration], [Competitive Differentiation]
