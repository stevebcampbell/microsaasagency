## Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log

### Log ID & Resultant Version: CO-001 -> v2.0
**Timestamp & Contributor(s)**: 2025-06-23, Platform Development Team

**The Premise**: The client onboarding process was designed for traditional fractional development services but needed enhancement to integrate the Human Co-Creator's Guiding Logic Log framework as a core differentiator and trust-building mechanism from the first client interaction.

**The Human Catalyst (Action & Source)**: Process enhancement directive to demonstrate human-authentication methodology throughout client onboarding rather than treating it as separate operational concern.

**Raw Human Input**: Client onboarding process integration requirement to ensure framework becomes visible and valuable to clients from initial contact through project delivery.

**The Core Rationale & Decision (The Human Synthesis)**: The decision to enhance the onboarding process with framework integration reflects the strategic importance of establishing trust and demonstrating value through transparency from the very first client interaction. This ensures that clients not only understand our methodology but experience its benefits immediately, positioning human-authentication as a core service differentiator rather than a back-office process. The enhanced onboarding now serves multiple purposes: operational efficiency, client education, and competitive differentiation through demonstrated transparency.

**Impact on Outcome (Secondary)**: Transformed standard onboarding process into strategic client education and trust-building system that positions human-authentication as core value proposition from day one.
